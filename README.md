# ast

`ast` explores one typed node-graph model, query system, and change-planning
runtime for heterogeneous structured resources such as repositories, source
code, documents, and databases.

The repository contains the architecture specification, implementation backlog,
and a buildable TypeScript monorepo. `@mirek/ast` provides immutable graph,
resource, schema, diagnostic, and capability contracts plus an executable lazy
query algebra. The CLI is not yet implemented.

Read [SPEC.md](./SPEC.md) for the architecture and [TODO.md](./TODO.md) for the
ordered set of work that remains.

## Workspace

- `@mirek/ast` — pure graph, adapter, query, and change-planning library; its
  model, schema, lazy query runtime, explain plans, and in-memory adapter are
  available now
- `@mirek/ast-cli` — CLI boundary reserved for later implementation

Both packages remain private until their public names and contracts are
stabilized.

## Query runtime

Queries are immutable `AsyncIterable` values. Fluent methods and functional
combinators construct the same logical plan. Operators stream by default;
`sort`, `groupBy`, and `join` report their buffering in the physical explain
plan. Execution propagates abort signals and closes adapter resources on normal
completion, cancellation, and failure.

```ts
import { distinct, fromAdapter, project, take } from "@mirek/ast";

const roots = fromAdapter(adapter, { uri: "memory:project" });
const names = project(
  take(distinct(roots), 10),
  (node) => node.snapshot.attributes.name,
);

console.log(names.explain());
const result = await names.toArray({ signal });
```

The public algebra includes filtering, projection, flat mapping, distinctness,
limits, counting, grouping, sorting, captures, equality joins, and bounded tree
or reference-edge traversal. `createInMemoryAdapter` supplies deterministic
fixtures for adapter and selector development without filesystem effects.

## Development

Requires Node.js 24 or newer and pnpm 11 or newer.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm check
pnpm build
```
